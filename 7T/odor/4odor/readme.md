# Generate results for 4 odors experiment.

## generate_statas.tcsh
Generate activation masks and statistics for each ROI. Try to extract time course from TENT deconvolution

## results.Rmd
Results for piriform and amygdala.

## results_Amy.Rmd
Results for different regions of amygdala.

## results_labels.Rmd
Analyze true labels and predicted labels, which can obtain accuracy and confusion matrices for each run.

## results_labels_mean.Rmd
Analyze true labels and predicted labels for all subject, computing group means.

## ratings.Rmd
Plot valence, intensity, and similarity ratings for odors presented by bottles or the olfactometer. Then, plot valence and intensity ratings for each run during the fMRI scan.

## roistatas.Rmd
Compute and plot mean voxel numbers for each ROI, and plot time courses.

## results_labels_render.R
Render results_labels.Rmd, results_labels_mean.Rmd, rating.Rmd, and roistatas.Rmd with parameters.
