# GLM and MVPA

## understandglm
Generate data and try to understand GLM and MVPA.

* MVPA and RSA focus on different facet of the data.
* MVPA accuracy is related to the mean value of activation.
* Colinear regressors will result in inflated variance.
* SVM has different kernels and corresponding parameters.
* RBF kenel is commonly used in image differentiation.
* Parameters c and g are used to balance overfit and underfit.
