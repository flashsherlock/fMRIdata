## cattiming.tcsh
Concatenate first 5 runs with 4 or 5 runs of S01. Resample and rename the first 5 EPI images, and align them to S01.

## edit_motion.m
When one of the run is removed, the motion.1D file should be edited.

## analyze_timing*.m
Remove the timing of 5th run.

## proc_fmri2xsmooth.tcsh
Process 12 runs.

## deconvolve*run*.tcsh
Deconvolve 11 or 12 runs with blur or volreg images generated by proc_fmri2xsmooth.tcsh.

## deconvolve_*va.tcsh
Deconvolve 4 runs with blur or volreg images of S01.

## run_decoding.m & decoding*.m
Do MVPA with 4, 11, or 12 runs (change variable `timing`).

## compare2day.tcsh
Compare 2 days of results of S01. 

## compr.m
Calculate correlations between two sessions.

## Cleandata*
RSA for 11 runs.
