# These are the scripts for Amygdala(TENT) analysis

## 3Deconvolvetent
Use `3dDeconvolve` (TENT function 'TENT(0,20,11)') to get these results and align to structural image (MNI152_T1_2009c+tlrc )
* OlfacValence: Upleasant > Pleasant
* FaceValence: Fearful > Happy
* Visible OlfacValence: Upleasant > Pleasant
* Visible FaceValenceF: Fearful > Happy  

The results are stored in `${subj}.analysis.tent+tlrc`, this file is then used to generate masks for Amygdala

## ROIstatent
Use `3dROIstats` to print the mean $\beta$ value to txt files

## catxt
Concatenate txt files of 20 subjects to one file for each condition

## extract_tent
Get data from the txt file.
Because the structures of data generated by tent and block function are different, extract_block.R can not be used here.
Data are stored in Amytent.RData.

## analyzeRtent
Analyze data stored in tent.RData file and generate Alltent.RData

## Other files
These files have been used but are not crucial in data analysis

### extract.m
Matlab script to extract data from txt files (Unsuccessful)

### plottent
Firt script to make plots by R (Backup)
