## makeROIabove0
Generate masks and use `3dROIstats` to print the mean $\beta$ value to txt files.

## fcluster
Use `3dClusterize` to find clusters.

## extract_tent
Get data from the txt file.
Because the structures of data generated by tent and block function are different, extract_block.R can not be used here.
Data are stored in Amytent.RData.

## analyzeRtent
Analyze data stored in tent.RData file and generate Alltent.RData

## Other files
These files have been used but are not crucial in data analysis

### parallelproc.tcsh
Run commands in parallel.
