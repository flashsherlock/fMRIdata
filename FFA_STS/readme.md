# These are the scripts for FFA&STS analysis

## 3Deconvolve
Use `3dDeconvolve` (BLOCK function 'BLOCK(10,1)') to get these results and align to structural image
* Visible > Invisible
* InvisibleFearful > InvisibleHappy
* InvisibleUnpleasant > InvisiblePleasant

the results are stored in `${subj}.analysisSF.+tlrc`, this file is then used to generate masks for FFA and aSTS

## ROIresample
Use `3dresample` to generate atlas masks from BN_atlas and use ROIresample to change voxel size (the same as MNI152_T1_2009c+tlrc )
* STS_right
* FFA_right

## makeROI05
Use `3dcalc` to generate final masks (regions in the BN_atlas FFA and aSTS whose activity in Visible > Invisible)

Use 3dROIstats to print the mean value to txt files

<!-- ## 3Deconvolvetent
get the same results as 3Deconvolve but use tent function -->

## ROIstatent
Use `3dROIstats` to print mean $\beta$ values to txt files

## extract_block
Get data from the txt file.
The data are stored in STS_FFA_block.RData

## ../Amygdala/extract_tent
Get data from the txt file.
Because the structures of data generated by tent and block function are different, extract_block.R can not be used here.
The data are stored in FFAtent.RData and STStent.RData

## analyzeR
Analyze data stored in RData file and generate All.RData

## analyzeRtent
Analyze data stored in tent.RData file and generate Alltent.RData

## plot_FS
Analyze data stored in All.RData and Alltent.RData, then generate a html file with plots
