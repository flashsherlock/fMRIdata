This repository stores my codes for fMRI, iEEG, behavior and other data analysis, including Matlab, AFNI, and R scripts.

# fMRI
The results can be visited here.
* [Amygdala](AmygdalaBLOCK/plot_Amy.html)
* [FFA&STS](FFA_STS/plot_FS.html)
* [PPI](PPI/plot_PPI.html)

## AmygdalaBlOCK
The analysis of Amygdala using BlOCK function.

## AmygdalaTENT
The analysis of Amygdala using TENT function.

## FFA_STS
The analysis of right STS and right FFA, including scripts using BlOCK and TENT function.

## PPI
Analyze the connectivity between amygdala and FFA/STS

## Cluster
Restrict the ROI to be continuous and guarantee the activation to stimulus is positive.

## Baseline
Use the time interval without any odor or visual stimulus as baseline.

## Invisible
Define ROI by the activation difference of invisible faces.

## 7T
Use afni_proc.py to analyze 7T data.

# Others
## learning
Stores some of the files and notes during learning.

## monkey
Some files for olfaction experitments on monkeys.

## consciousness
Analysis and experiment programms for iEEG study.

## bind
Experiment on blind people.
