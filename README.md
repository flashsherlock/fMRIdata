This repository stores my codes for fMRI, iEEG, behavior and other data analysis, including Matlab, AFNI, and R scripts.

# fMRI

## AmygdalaBlOCK
The analysis of Amygdala using BlOCK function.

## AmygdalaTENT
The analysis of Amygdala using TENT function.

## FFA_STS
The analysis of right STS and right FFA, including scripts using BlOCK and TENT function.

## PPI
Analyze the connectivity between amygdala and FFA/STS

## Cluster
Restrict the ROI to be continuous and guarantee the activation to stimulus is positive.

## Baseline
Use the time interval without any odor or visual stimulus as baseline.

## Invisible
Define ROI by the activation difference of invisible faces.

# Others
## 7T
Use afni_proc.py to analyze 7T data.

## learning
Files and notes during learning.

## monkey
Files for experitments on monkeys.

## consciousness
Files for iEEG study.

## blind
Experiment on blind people.
